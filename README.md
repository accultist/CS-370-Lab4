# CS-370
LAB: TopDownShmup 
Authored: Dr. Gill, Obinna Kalu, Adham Said

Copied straight from the description of the lab documentation:

"To get more in-depth experience with Unreal 5, we’re going to make a top-down shoot ‘em up. 
You’ll have a character that runs around and shoots at enemies." 

Instructions:
Download .zip file.
Open the unreal engine project file located in the folder.
Build project and download shaders.
Run the game.

Notable bugs:
- Player can still attack on death
- Dwarfs will only attack after being within melee distance of player, and the player moves
